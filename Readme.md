# facebook-test-users

  This is a script for managing Facebook [test users]
  (http://developers.facebook.com/docs/test_users/).

## Usage

  Start it like:

    ./cli.py APP_ID APP_SECRET

  Type `?` at the prompt for a list of commands.

## cli.txt

  To keep from having to enter the APP_ID and APP_SECRET repeatedly,
  each time you enter these on the command line they are saved to a file
  named cli.txt. Next time you can run ./cli.py without these and it will
  look for this file to load the values.

## API Usage

  The user list is automatically reloaded after any command that could
  change it. Use the `r` command to reload it manually.
